    <h1>SOLOS AI DEMO</h1>
  <div class="explanation">
    <p>this is what the raw response from @content looks like:</p>
    <strong style="color: blue"> <%= @content %></strong>
    <p>what does it look like? thats right, a Hash! ðŸ¤©  it does look a bit stranger because theres also arrays inside this hash, but its nothing we havent seen before!</p>

    <p>Now we ONLY want to get the actually message it sends back, and if we look at that hash we can our message: "Yes, Solo, this is a successful API call!" stored in "content"</p>
    <p>But how can we pull out just that message?</p>
    <p> We're going to have to use what we know about Hashes work to find the right key for it</p>
    <p> So to find exactly what we want we're going to play around with the @content variable (which is that mess of a hash we're looking at up there^)</p>

    <p>And then do something like @content['choices'][0]['message']['content']</p>

    <p>to break down how that works ive said from the variable: 'response_from_gpt' I want to go into the 'choices' key (which holds and array) and then go into that array by using [0] (which if you remember is just saying I want the first item in an array) and then go to the 'messages' key which holds ANOTHER hash lol and go into the 'content' key for message</p>



    <p>which is finally going to give us:</p>
  <strong style="color: green"> <%= @content['choices'][0]['message']['content'] %></strong>




  <p>now lets make a simple form to just ask questions to chat gpt</p>
  <%= link_to '<button class="btn btn-warning">GPT FORM</button>'.html_safe, chat_path %>

  </div>

  </body>
